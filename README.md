# Dictionary
This is an humble effort to create a simple, clean, easy to use and to the point android dictionary application.
The current solutions are bloated, hard to use or just full of advertisements. This application aims to be a community supported open-source dictionary app for android.

###Features 
* Word lookup should give me meaning, pronunciation, sample sentances, synonyms and antonyms (if applicable).
* Drop down suggestion during word search search.
* A way to 'favourite' words.
* "shake" to get a new word.
* Should be available offline.

###How to start
* scrape the web for all the words - create a json dictionary
* create a Flask based RESTful web service
* create a android application
